# File information scripts

Simple scripts written to practise using `File` and `Dir` in ruby. The two
scripts are my solutions to exercise found in
[The Bastards Book of Ruby article on IO](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/io/).

### largest

displays the names and sizes of the 10 largest files in the current
working directory.

## extensions

displays a list of file extensions in the current working directory, along with
the file count and the sum of their sizes.
